----------------------------------

* What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  How did you solve those problems?

The most challenging aspect of this assignment was to figure out how
to compile all of the handlebars templates in the right files. Also we managed
to use a lot of different node.js tools so it took some time to figure out how
to use them all together.

* What did you learn from the assignment?  Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?

I learned a lot from this assignment. It was interesting to me and it took
some time to figure out everything as there is a lot of different syntax
for each so managing that took some time.

* What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?  Specific websites?  Lectures?  The class Piazza forum?  The TAs?  How did you use each of these resources?

I used Piazza heavily, it proved to be extremely useful for the times I got stuck and could not figure out what was wrong. It helps to have an extra set of eyes. I also used the lecture recordings as well, it helped to have more concrete guiding to creating my handlebars files. I did not know that I had to follow the handlebars directory ordering so heavily.

* What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?

I had to google how to create a custom handlebars helpers. It helped me easily to accomplish #4 for full credit as I could simply tell the handlebars templates when to implement the button or not.
